### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [National Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://www.ncas.ac.uk) Research Scientist / Cambridge SRA working with [UKESM1](https://ukesm.ac.uk) and developing [UKCA](https://www.ukca.ac.uk)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working writing up recent work on the [radiative impact of replacing greenhouse gases](https://paultgriffiths.github.io/talks/2021-03-10) such as methane with H2 as a fuel source, just published by BEIS [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/atmospheric-implications-of-increased-hydrogen-use).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
  - about the Julia language 
  - new ML techniques  by participating in a year-long [Accelerate Residency](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-residency-programme).
  - [ESMValTool](https://esmvaltool.org).  Ask me about the next UKCA ESMValTool training on model evaluation to follow on from the first at the Met Office.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate 
  - using the [CMIP6 data archive](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) and its capability for data-driven science.
  - whole-atmosphere box-models for [methane emissions](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RG000675) reductions and [other questions](https://ncas.ac.uk/scientists-develop-new-method-to-assess-ozone-layer-recovery/)
- ðŸ¥³ I recently joined the Software Carpentry Instructors, having completed their excellent training - [apply here!](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about setting up projects using the [Centre for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/products/osf) framework, working with [Cambridge University Data Champions](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions)
