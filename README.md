  ### Hi there 👋

I'm a lecturer at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/chemistry/), aligned with the [Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/chemistry/research/acrg/) working with [UKESM1](https://ukesm.ac.uk) and developing [UKCA](https://www.ukca.ac.uk). My pronouns are he/him.

#### working on 
- ✍️ [Seb](https://github.com/shmh40) and I led a [community review](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2025/egusphere-2024-3739/) of ML/AI in tropospheric ozone research for phase 2 of [IGAC TOAR](https://igacproject.org/activities/TOAR/TOAR-II)[ML4O3](https://igacproject.org/ml4o3-focus-working-group) - check out the [website](https://github.com/ML4O3/)

- 🥳 I'm excited to be a co-I of the Schmidt Futures Virtual Earth System Research Institute [VESRI](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-earth-system-research-institute-vesri/) [FETCH4](https://fetch4.github.io) project focusing on the role of methane in the Earth system.  This project is led by [Alex Turner](https://github.com/alexjturner) (UW), [Lee Murray](https://github.com/ltmurray) and Vasily Vlasenko.
  
- 👨🏻‍💻 I remain involved with the [TerraFIRMA project](https://terrafirma.ac.uk/) NERC National Capability Multi-Centre Science programme, and WP2, focusing on the role of methane emissions in future climate.

- ‍✈️ Work started on the 'Reducing aviation Emissions' uncertain climate impacts: NOx' project. We are looking at the climate impact.

#### about me 

My research aims to use models to study atmospheric chemistry. I'm interested in aerosol chemistry, ozone production, VOC oxidation and air pollution. 

🌱 I’m currently  
- learning about the Julia language, and building my experience in  ML.
- I took part in a year-long [Accelerate Residency](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-residency-programme).

And recently

- 🥳 qualified as a Software Carpentry Instructor - you can do so too! [apply here!](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/)
- 📫 joined blueksy: [profile here](https://bsky.app/profile/paultgriffiths.github.io)

  
#### I’m open to collaborations!
  - using the [CMIP6 data archive](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) and its capability for data-driven science.
  - whole-atmosphere box-models for [methane emissions](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RG000675) reductions and [other questions](https://ncas.ac.uk/scientists-develop-new-method-to-assess-ozone-layer-recovery/)
