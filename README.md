### Hi there 👋

I'm a [National Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://www.ncas.ac.uk) Research Scientist / Cambridge SRA working with [UKESM1](https://ukesm.ac.uk) and developing [UKCA](https://www.ukca.ac.uk)

- 🔭 I’m working on the [radiative impact of replacing greenhouse gases](https://paultgriffiths.github.io/talks/2021-03-10) such as methane with H2 as a fuel source, now funded via [UKRI](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FX010236%2F1).
- 🌳 My main interest is in developing capability for atmospheric chemistry modelling, currently focusing on improving our treatment of VOC oxidation and air pollution, funded via [UKRI](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FX000516%2F1) collaborating with University of Nottingham, and building on the [work](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020MS002420) of James Weber and Scott Archer-Nicholls.  Aerosol chemistry is also an interest.
- 🥳 I'm excited to be a co-I of the Schmidt Futures Virtual Earth System Research Institute [VESRI](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-earth-system-research-institute-vesri/) [FETCH4](https://fetch4.github.io) project focusing on the role of methane in the Earth system.  This project is led by [Alex Turner](https://github.com/alexjturner) (UW), [Lee Murray](https://github.com/ltmurray) and Vasily Vlasenko.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I am helping lead the Cambridge contribution to the NERC National Capability Multi-Centre Science programme focusing on the role of methane emissions in future climate.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
  - about the Julia language 
  - new ML techniques  by participating in a year-long [Accelerate Residency](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-residency-programme).
  - [ESMValTool](https://esmvaltool.org).  Ask me about the next UKCA ESMValTool training on model evaluation to follow on from the first at the Met Office.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate 
  - using the [CMIP6 data archive](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) and its capability for data-driven science.
  - whole-atmosphere box-models for [methane emissions](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RG000675) reductions and [other questions](https://ncas.ac.uk/scientists-develop-new-method-to-assess-ozone-layer-recovery/)
- 🥳 I recently joined the Software Carpentry Instructors, having completed their excellent training - [apply here!](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/)
- 💬 Ask me about setting up projects using the [Centre for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/products/osf) framework, working with [Cambridge University Data Champions](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions)
